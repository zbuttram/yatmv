### What special features does YATMV have? (Why make another one?)
* Lets you quickly switch focus between streams while keeping an eye on the rest
* Avoids reloading the Twitch player to lower the appearance of the dreaded purple screen
* Load as many streams as your PC (and/or browser) will handle with the scrollable layout
